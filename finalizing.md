### What next?

- You have now succesfully installed CFW on your Nintendo Switch.
- You can manage save data using Checkpoint (by Flagbrew), a save manager that was included in this starting pack.
- You can download new homebrew using hb App Store (also known as Appstore-NX, by vgmoose).
- You can transfer files to your Switch over FTP using sys-ftpd (by jakibaki). No authentication is needed and the FTP server runs on port 5000.
- You will probably want to create a NAND backup, in case you brick your Switch. Steps to do so can be found in the [FAQ](faq.html#nand-dump){: .a-table target="_blank"}.
- When rebooting, your access to CFW will be lost, unless you follow the steps at Launching CFW again.

It is highly advised to also read the [FAQ](faq.html){: .a-table target="_blank")}
