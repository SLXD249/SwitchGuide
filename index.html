        <div class="alert alert-danger">
          This guide uses sdsetup. sdsetup is used because it has the most up-to-date files. That said, sdsetup also allows generating SX OS/ReiNX setups. These are not supported by this guide and not supported on the previously linked Discord.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
          The Hekate bootmenu will reference a Discord server. This Discord server is not considered supported by this guide and not supported on the previously linked Discord.

        <h3>Terminology used in this guide</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hekate</strong>: A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch.</li>
            <li><strong>Atmosphére</strong>: The CFW made by ReSwitched.</li>
            <li><strong>CFW</strong>: A Custom Firmware. Custom Firmware permits access to homebrew on the Nintendo Switch.</li>            
            <li><strong>RCM</strong>: A special mode of the Nintendo Switch's Tegra RCM chip that thanks to a bug allows us to push any payload to it. This exploit is known as ShofEL2 or fusee-gelee.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What are we doing to run homebrew on the Switch?</h3>
        <p>
          This guide will boot you into Atmosphére using a combination of the RCM, the Hekate bootloader and Atmosphére CFW.
          In addition, this guide will enable an FTP server on your Switch to simplify transferring files while in Horizon.
          You will also be able to access the Homebrew menu by launching the album applet.
          This has only been tested on firmwares 5.0.2 and 5.1.0 and 6.0.0, but theoretically should work on all firmware versions.
          Certain applications may not work on certain firmware versions so YMMV.
        </p>
        <h3>What you will need.</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>A "first-generation" Switch. (All Switch consoles before July 2018 will work.)</li>
            <li>A way to put your Switch into RCM. See <a class="a-table" href="https://xghostboyx.github.io/RCM-Guide" target="_blank">this guide for more information.</a></li>
            <li>A host PC running Windows, Linux, macOS or ChromeOS, or an Android device.</li>
            <li>A USB Type-C to USB-A cable, or a USB Type-C to USB Type-C cable. (Depending on what your host PC supports)</li>
            <li>If you are using an Android device, you need a way to connect the Switch to it, either a USB OTG cable, or USB-C to USB-C cable depending on what your device supports.</li>
            <li>A microSD card 2GB or larger, formatted to either FAT32, or exFAT (only if your switch has the exFAT support "update")</li>
            <li>A zip generated on <a class="a-table" href="https://www.sdsetup.com/console?switch#atmosphere;atmos_musthave;atmos_bootlogo;atmos_sysftpd;hbmenu;appstorenx;checkpoint;hekate;tegrarcmsmash;">sdsetup.com</a>.

        <h3>What are the advantages to running homebrew?</h3>
        <p>
          Running homebrew will allow you to run tools such as <a class="a-table" href="https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/Checkpoint" target="_blank">Checkpoint, a save manager.</a>
          You also can run emulators like RetroArch to play retro games on the Switch.
          In addition, you can run homebrew games such as <a class="a-table" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/tetriswitch-a-tetris-clone-for-the-switch.498481" target="_blank">tetriswitch</a> and <a class="a-table" href="https://github.com/I-EAT-CHEEZE-YO/switch_sdl_pong" target="_blank"/>Pong</a>.

        <h3>Making your bootkit</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
          For the following steps, when making folders and renaming files, do not make or rename them with the quotes.
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
          You will not have to create this bootkit if you are running Android or ChromeOS.<br>
          
          <a class="a-table" href="#android-chrome-prep">Continue to OS-Specific preparations if you use Android or chromeOS.</a>
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
            You will only have to create this bootkit once. When an update for hekate releases, generate a new zip file on sdsetup.com (using the URL provided to you from What You Will Need) and replace "payload.bin" with the file starting with "hekate_ctcaer" in the "payloads" folder (rename it to "payload.bin" and copy it to the "bin" folder).
        </div>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Extract the sdsetup.com zip to a folder.</li>
            <li>Make a new folder called "bootkit".</li>
            <li>In the bootkit folder, place "boot_cfw_win32.bat", "boot_cfw_win64.bat" and "boot_macOS-Linux.sh"</li>
            <li>In the bootkit folder, make a folder called "bin".</li>
            <li>In the "bin" folder, place "fusee-launcher.py" and "intermezzo.bin"</li>
            <li>From the sdsetup.com zip, copy the following files to the "bin" folder:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>From the "pc" -> "tegrarcmsmash" folder copy both exes in the directories to the "bin" folder. Name the one from the Win32 folder "TegraRcmSmash_Win32" and the one in the x64 folder "TegraRcmSmash_Win64". (If you have file extensions enabled, make sure that they still end in .exe).
              <li>From the "payloads" folder copy the file starting with "hekate_ctcaer" to the "bin" folder and rename it to "payload.bin"</li>
              </ul>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Setting up your sd card</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            When Hekate updates, it is advised to replace all folders except for the "switch" and "Nintendo" folders with those from a newly generated zip from sdsetup.com (using the URL provided to you from What You Will Need).
        </div>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Turn off your Switch and put your microSD card in your computer.</li>
            <li>Copy over all files in the "sd" folder from the sdsetup.com zip to the root of your Switch's microSD card.</li>
            <li>Safely remove your microSD card and plug it back in your Switch.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>You have now succesfully installed CFW on your Nintendo Switch.</li>
            <li>You can manage save data using Checkpoint (by Flagbrew), a save manager that was included in this starting pack.</li>
            <li>You can download new homebrew using hb App Store (also known as Appstore-NX, by vgmoose).</li>
            <li>You can transfer files to your Switch over FTP using sys-ftpd (by jakibaki). No authentication is needed and the FTP server runs on port 5000.</li>
            <li>You will probably want to create a NAND backup, in case you brick your Switch. You can do so from the Hekate menu.</li>
            <li>When rebooting, your access to CFW will be lost, unless you follow the steps under Launching CFW again.</li>
