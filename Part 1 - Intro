Nintendo Homebrew Channel 2.0 Master Guide<br/>
Page 1 - Introduction<br/>
Ever since the Wii, Nintendo has been one of the most easily hackable companies to date. In fact, it seems that over time, once the proper tools are available, it's become easier and easier for the average gamer to modify their own systems. But for the most part, the methods and tools needed to do so are scattered all over the internet and are only accessible by those who know where to look. Also, some people also don't know what types of tools are the most beneficial. But what we will attempt to do is centralize the basic Nintendo hacking system, which will literally spell out in plain English what you need to perform a successful hack without all the technical mumbo-jumbo that most sites tend to throw in. We will make it so that virtually any noob can hack their systems from scratch with little to no beginning knowledge of all the fine details. This guide was made on an entirely volunteer service from people who care about hacking Nintendo and are willing to share the knowledge with others.<br/>
